# Open an app from the command line in macOS

To open an application from the command line in macOS, you can use the `open`
command followed by the `-a` flag and the name of the application. F
or example, to open Safari, you would use the following command:

```shell
open -a "Safari"
```

You can also open files or directories with the `open` command.
For example, to open a specific PDF file in Preview, you would use:

```shell
open -a "Preview" /path/to/your/file.pdf
```

I find this handy when I've generated coverage reports and want to quickly view
them in a browser.
